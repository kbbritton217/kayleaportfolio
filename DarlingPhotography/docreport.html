            <h2>Document Report</h2>
              <h3>Topic/Background/Introduction</h3>
			    <h4>Darling Photography<br>darlingphotography.com</h4>
			      <p>The purpose of this site is to provide the target audience of Ellettsville, Spencer, Gosport, and Bloomington Indiana with a means to research the services offered by Darling Photography. This site gives a one stop shop for viewing past work, learning more about Kendra Darling, and communicating with me.</p>
				  <p>As stated above, this site exists to provide general information about Darling Photography. The target audience includes all ages in the areas surrounding Spencer, IN(Gosport, Bloomington, Ellettsville, Indianapolis). It is assumed that the majority of this auience has experience surfing the web either on a computer or mobile device.</p>
              <h3>Problem Exploration</h3>
			    <h4>How do you want potential clients to feel when they see your site?</h4>
			      <p>I want my customers to feel like I am approachable. I want them to to see my work and have an urgent desire to work with me. I want them to see that I am professional but not at the expense of having a good time.</p>
				<h4>What information absolutely must be on this site?</h4>
			      <p>Samples of my work are probably the most important items. They really need to have a way to contact me as well. It would be great if there was a little bit about me so they know who they'd be working with.</p>
				<h4>Do you have a color scheme or theme in mind?</h4>
			      <p>I can't say that I do have particular colors or a theme in mind. I definitely want my logo to be included. I tend to lean towards a country-chic style so if that type of feeling could be invoked that would be great.</p>
				<h4>Benchmarks</h4>
				  <p>Kendra will share this site on social media as well as with anyone who expresses an interest in booking throug social media. Benchmarks for success will be the number of conversions of interest to sales and the number of interest hits she receives directly from the website.
				  <p>There are a lot of images in the images folder and a decent number of images on the "work pages" that could affect load time.</p>
				  <p>The website has 16 pages total and is fairly simple. It includes one video embedded from instagram and approximately 58 images as well as logos an icons. The Contact Me page has external links to the Darling Photography Facebook page and Kendra Darling's Instagram page. There are about 3 levels. For example, if you start at Home, you can travel to Get to Know Me and through that page you can find My Darling Family. Similarly, you can travel to See My Work from Home for more page options that total 4 levels.
				  <p>Because this is not a site a client for a real client, assumptions were made about photo subjects and venues. Also, all of the text was created by me. If I were to pitch this to Kendra, she would need to make sure all photo information is correct and that she is comfortable with the text of the site.</p>
				  <p>Again, this is not a real client site so the site will be uploaded to bobbi.ivytech.edu. If this was a real client site, I would provide Kendra with a copy of the site on a flash drive and assist her with purchasing a domain name and uploaing the site via FTP. I would also show her how to update photos in HTML, CSS, and the file explorer that way she could update the site each quarter and not have to pay a developer to do it. I would also be sure to add more metadata to make sure the site was easier to find from search engines.
              <h3>Requirements Analysis and Specification</h3>
			    <h4>Goal Exploration</h4>
			      <p>A lot of the information provided in this section is not necessary for this site or does not apply to the goals I have listed above. The site was tested mainly in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer but it was reviewed in Firefox as well. While the entire site is not mobile friendly, almost half of it is. The Home, Work, and Birthdays pages were all designed specifically for mobile usage. Yoga, Venues, BreakMold and SiteMap all implement responsivie design and perform well on a mobile screen size, as well. Venues impelements javascript so that only one image is viewed at a time and it also connects to Google Maps.</p>
				<p>I will recommend Bluhost for hosting the site as they are very cost effective. I will also offer my services for routine site maintenance once a quarter but explain that it is something that can be hired out as necessary. Kendra Darling will need to keep the site files on her own computer or storage device. The site is primarily static as it mostly just uses HTML and CSS. I will consider it dynamic though since there is some javascript on the Venues page. There are no special server or client hardware/software considerations. The site does not utilize a database so there are no extra security concerns.</p>
              <h3>Information Architecture, Organization, and Design</h3>
			    <h4>Site</h4>
			      <p>This site is intended to serve as a billboard for Darling Photography. It is not intended to allow users to book appointments in a calendar or make payments. These may be features that Kendra wants to implement in the future but could produce issues. She could feel obligated to keep appointments that are booked and get overworked or not be able to ensure that payment has been made if she trusts a client to go to the website later. She may be able to include a feature that allows clients to log in to her site to retieve their photos and not allow them access without receipt of payment.</p>
			    <h4>Topology</h4>
			      <p>Rather than fully discuss each page that connects to each page I am going to discuss a few things and have included a picture below of my site's flowchart. All pages have a favicon and logo, navigation list, and a link to the site map in the footer. The site map is the only page with a link to this Documentation Report and it also links to every other page on the site. The Venues page has both javascript and an external link to Google Maps. Contact Me has a form and external links to both Facebook and Instagram. My Darling Family has a video embedded from Instagram. </p>
				  <div class="desktoppic">

				  <p>Originally I wanted the whole site to resemble breakmold.html's layout. I'm glad I changed my mind about that though because I think it wouldn't have been as asy to traverse and I don't think that layout works well for a 15 page site.</p>
              <h3>Testing, Maintenance, and Promotion Plan</h3>
			    <h4>Review</h4>
			      <p>My husband reviewed my site and provided some great feedback. He mentioned that he didn't like that my javascript in Venues was not obvious and he only knew to click on the headers because I told him to. I went in and added a hover to those h4 elements because of this feedback. He also mentioned that he didn't understand why my paragraphs appeared when you clicked on a header in Venues but didn't disappear when you clicked on it a second time. This would be a really cool feature that seems simple but I explained that I simply don't know how to do that yet. He also suggested that a secondary nav would be nice to b able to get back and forth inside Events without having to go back to that page everytime. I decided not to add this feature but I do think I would if this were for a paying client. The last thing he mentioned was that he assumed the Darling Photography in the footer would be a link back to Home. I meant for this to be more of a copyright feature than a link s I did not change it.</p>
			    <h4>Updating</h4>
			      <p>As mentioned earlier, I'd like to give Kendra the option of learning how to update her pictures. There's no reason for her to pay a developer if she doesn't need to. If she does not want to learn how then I will recommend that she reach out to me when she wants to make updates. This will likely happen every 3-6 months as she does service quite a few clients for the wedding season and a lot of her other sessions occur in the late fall.</p>
			    <h4>Advertising and SEO</h4>
			      <p>While I would add metadata and optimize image names for search engine optimization it will be Kendra's responisbility to advertise the site to draw traffic. She can advertise on Darling Photography's and her personal Facebook pages as well as Instagram and Pinterest. She can also ask past clients to share the site on their Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter.</p>
              <h3>Implementation and Reflection</h3>
			    <h4>Resources</h4>
			      <p>While I relied heavily on the internet to build this site there aren't really any sources to site. I used the textbook and google for my code and the pictures came from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KendraDarlingPhotography/"><em>Facebook</em></a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/k.darling/"><em>Instagram</em></a>.</p>
				<h4>The Big Picture</h4>
			      <p>Thinking of an idea for this site was so easy. 14 weeks ago I thought it would be this cute responsive site with all sorts of pictures and that it would be a piece of cake to create. Obviously, there was a lot more to it that I ever imagined. Thinking of 15 pages of content to use and a video definitely posed a problem for me. If I were doing this site for pay I would not have 15 pages as it just isn't necessary tohave that many pages to accomplish the goals of the site. I also didn't feel that the table was something I needed or wanted to use and am afraid it will be construed as an after thought. Technically, for a real site this could be used to produce a price table but some professionals would prefer that a potential client contact them before they see the price. This would ultimately be Kendra's decision.</p>
				  <p>Overall, my main issue was being underprepared. I had an unrealistic idea of the time it would take to creat this site and had no idea what my timeline should've looked like throughout the project. Now I have a better idea of what should have happened. If I did the class over again, I would want to have my page mockups completed by the time I submit my project proposal. Then I would try to work on the HTML of 3 pages a week for 5 weeks. I would also want to have all my pictures, videos and links ready at that point. The next 2 weeks would be for CSS and adding all my multimedia. That would've had me much more prepared for the peer review. At that point, I would just have to make changes based on my review and creat my javascript and robots files. I don't think there was really any way for me to learn this eithout experiencing it first and I;m glad it happened in a class and not while working with a real client.</p>
				  <p>In the future, I'd like for every page to be mobile friendly or hidden from mobile users. In 2017 we have to assume that every website will be accessed via a mobile device at some point. I woul also be able to ge tthe pictures straight from Kendra and the quality would be much better.</p>
              <h3>Appendices</h3>
			    <h4>Page Validations</h4>
				  <p>Almost every page had a validation error for the font I found on Google Fonts. Since the code was given to me by Google I did not change it and just accepted the error in validation. A few pages also had warnings for Sections not having headings, I chose to ignore those as well.
